The two important pieces of code are the lstmmodel.py and runner.py scripts.

The lstmmodel.py script contains the data cleaning, encoding, time split cross-validation, and modeling and prediction functions.

The runner.py script calls the lstmmodel.py functions and loops them through different hyperparameters and time splits for cross validation
